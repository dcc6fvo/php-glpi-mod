# php-glpi-mod

This is a modification for GLPI 10.0.x that allows users to open tickets in entities other than the root entity, accessing them through the buttons present in the "Home" profile. For this to be possible, this "Home" profile must be configured on the root entity. In this model, users cannot open tickets in the root entity, only in the sub-entities.
